# Product Requirements Document - Southbound

**Author:** Michaelaquadro
**Date:** 2025-12-12

## Executive Summary

Southbound is a purpose-driven recruitment platform designed for the African market. Unlike traditional job boards that match CVs to job descriptions, Southbound matches people to purpose — focusing on person-fit over job-fit.

The platform uses voice-first profiling to capture who candidates really are, moving beyond the limitations of text-based applications. Job seekers speak naturally about themselves, and the system identifies roles and cultures where they'll genuinely thrive.

For employers, Southbound delivers candidates who aren't just qualified on paper but aligned in values, communication style, and purpose. Both sides receive soft steering hints for transparent, purposeful connections.

**Vision:** Build your future. Find your purpose.

**Market:** African recruitment market, positioned as a PNet alternative with a fundamentally different philosophy.

### What Makes This Special

- **Voice-first profiling:** Candidates speak naturally rather than filling forms, revealing who they truly are
- **Person over CV:** Matching focuses on the whole person — values, communication style, purpose — not just credentials
- **Radical transparency:** Both job seekers and employers get honest insights about fit before committing
- **Purpose-driven:** Built for people seeking meaningful work, not just any job

## User Journeys

### Journey 1: Thabo Molefe - Finding Purpose After Corporate Burnout

Thabo is a 32-year-old accountant in Johannesburg who's spent eight years climbing the corporate ladder at a Big Four firm. He's technically successful — good salary, respected title — but he dreads Monday mornings. The work feels meaningless, his manager micromanages everything, and he hasn't felt excited about a project in years. He's scrolled through PNet and LinkedIn dozens of times but every job looks the same: another grey cubicle, another set of KPIs that don't matter to him.

One evening, frustrated after another soul-crushing day, Thabo sees a Southbound ad: "Stop matching your CV. Start matching your purpose." Curious, he taps through. Instead of uploading his CV, he's invited to have a conversation. He speaks into his phone for about 8 minutes, answering questions about when he feels most alive, what kind of team dynamics energise him, and what impact he wants his work to have.

The next morning, Thabo opens Southbound to find three role matches. One immediately catches his eye — a finance lead position at a renewable energy startup. The match card shows why: "Strong alignment on purpose (environmental impact), collaborative culture, high autonomy environment." He'd never have found this role on PNet — it wasn't tagged as "accountant" and the company is too small to appear in his usual searches.

Thabo applies with one tap. Two weeks later, he's interviewing — and for the first time in years, he's excited. The startup's founder mentions they chose to interview him because Southbound indicated he'd thrive in their culture. Three months later, Thabo starts his new job. A year in, he's still there — the first role he hasn't wanted to escape in a decade.

### Journey 2: Naledi Dlamini - Escaping the Wrong Fit Before It's Too Late

Naledi is a 26-year-old marketing graduate in Cape Town, six months into her first "real" job at an agency. On paper, it was perfect — a creative role at a buzzy agency. In reality, she's miserable. The culture is cutthroat, the hours are brutal, and her manager takes credit for her ideas. She's already looking to leave but terrified of making the same mistake twice.

She signs up for Southbound specifically because of the transparency promise. During her voice profile, she finds herself being honest in ways she couldn't on a job application — about wanting a collaborative environment, about needing a manager who actually mentors, about caring more about meaningful work than impressive clients.

When her matches arrive, each comes with culture insights she's never seen before: "This team has low turnover and strong mentorship culture" or "Fast-paced environment, expect long hours during campaigns." One role shows a yellow flag: "Management style may not match your preferences" — exactly the warning she needed.

Naledi applies to a mid-sized purpose-driven brand consultancy. The match indicated strong culture alignment. During the interview, she asks specific questions about team dynamics — and the hiring manager is impressed she did her homework. She gets the offer. Six months into her new role, she finally understands what work-life balance feels like.

### Journey 3: Sipho Nkosi - The Hiring Manager Who Stopped Wasting Time

Sipho runs a 15-person fintech startup in Durban. He's hired four developers in the past year — and lost three of them within six months. The technical skills were fine, but the culture fit was terrible. One couldn't handle the startup chaos. Another needed more structure than Sipho could provide. The third clashed with the team's collaborative style. Each bad hire cost him months of productivity and tens of thousands in recruitment fees.

When Sipho posts his next developer role on Southbound, the experience is different. Instead of just listing requirements, he answers questions about his team's working style, decision-making process, and growth stage. Southbound builds a culture profile alongside the job description.

The candidates he receives are different too. Instead of 200 applications to screen, he gets 15 — each pre-qualified not just on skills but on fit. One candidate's match card notes: "Thrives in ambiguity, self-directed, previous startup experience, values impact over stability." That's exactly what Sipho needs.

He interviews five candidates. Hires two. Both are still with him a year later — his best retention rate ever. The time he used to spend screening CVs now goes into building his product.

### Journey 4: Ayanda Moyo - Platform Admin Keeping the Ecosystem Healthy

Ayanda is the lead platform admin for Southbound, working from the Joburg office. Her job is ensuring the marketplace stays healthy — quality profiles, legitimate employers, and a fair matching system.

Her morning starts with the admin dashboard. She reviews flagged profiles — a job seeker whose responses seemed AI-generated, an employer who received multiple "misleading culture info" complaints. She listens to audio samples, reviews the evidence, and makes calls: the AI profile gets suspended with an invitation to re-record authentically; the employer gets a warning and their culture profile locked for review.

Mid-morning, she checks marketplace health metrics. The candidate-to-role ratio in tech is getting tight — too many seekers, not enough quality roles. She flags this for the sales team to prioritise tech employer acquisition.

Afternoon brings a support escalation. A job seeker claims they were matched with a role that misrepresented the culture. Ayanda investigates: reviews the employer's original culture profile, checks if it's been updated, compares against reviews from other placements. She finds the employer's situation changed — new management shifted the culture. She updates the employer's profile with a "culture in transition" flag and reaches out to explain why.

Her work keeps Southbound trustworthy — the key differentiator that makes the whole system work.

### Journey 5: Lerato Khumalo - Support Specialist Solving the Unsolvable

Lerato handles escalated support tickets for Southbound. Today's first ticket: a job seeker claims their voice profile "doesn't sound like them" and wants to know why they're getting mismatched roles.

Lerato reviews the profile. The audio quality is poor — recorded in a noisy environment, some answers cut off. She calls the seeker, Mpho, who explains he recorded it on a taxi because he was excited to try the app. Lerato walks him through re-recording in a quiet space, explaining how audio quality affects the profile. Mpho re-records that evening; his next set of matches feel much more accurate.

Second ticket: an employer is frustrated that their top candidate accepted another offer before they could interview. Lerato checks the timeline — the employer took 12 days to respond to the match notification. She explains the competitive market for strong candidates and suggests enabling instant notifications. She also flags this pattern to product: maybe employers need a "candidate interest timer" showing how hot a match is.

Third ticket: a candidate wants to know why they weren't matched with a specific company they love. Lerato can see the match score was low on culture fit — but she can't reveal the employer's culture profile details. She carefully explains that the matching prioritises long-term fit and suggests the candidate apply directly if they're certain it's right for them, while noting that Southbound's data suggests it might not be the best match.

Every ticket teaches Lerato something about how people use (and misuse) the platform — insights she feeds back to product and design.

## Innovation & Novel Patterns

### Detected Innovation Areas

**1. Voice-First Profiling**
Traditional recruitment starts with CVs — polished, keyword-optimised documents that hide the person behind the credentials. Southbound inverts this by making voice the primary input. Speaking naturally for 8-10 minutes reveals communication style, authenticity, and personality in ways text cannot. This is a fundamental rethinking of how candidates present themselves.

**2. Person-Fit Over Job-Fit**
The recruitment industry optimises for matching keywords (skills, experience, job titles) to job descriptions. Southbound challenges this by matching the whole person — values, working style, purpose — to organisational culture. This is closer to how great teams actually form: people who work well together, not just people with the right credentials.

**3. Two-Sided Transparency**
Most platforms serve one side (employers or job seekers). Southbound provides genuine transparency to both — job seekers see real culture insights, employers see candidates pre-qualified on fit, not just skills. This creates a marketplace incentive for honesty.

### Market Context & Competitive Landscape

- **PNet/CareerJunction (SA):** Traditional keyword-matching job boards. No voice, no culture matching, volume-based model.
- **LinkedIn:** Network-first with increasingly AI-powered matching, but still CV/credential-centric.
- **Culture Amp / Peakon:** Measure existing culture but don't match candidates to it.
- **Pymetrics / HireVue:** AI-powered assessments but more gamification than genuine voice profiling.

Southbound's combination of voice-first + purpose matching + two-sided transparency appears unique in the African market and differentiated globally.

### Validation Approach

**Voice-first hypothesis:** Measure profile completion rates and match satisfaction. If voice profiles lead to better matches (higher user ratings, longer retention), the hypothesis is validated.

**Person-fit hypothesis:** Track 12-month retention for Southbound placements vs industry average. If retention is significantly higher, the matching philosophy is validated.

**Transparency hypothesis:** A/B test transparent culture insights vs hidden. If transparency increases application quality and reduces post-hire disappointment, the hypothesis is validated.

### Risk Mitigation

**Voice capture risk:** African mobile networks can be unreliable. Mitigation: progressive audio upload, quality detection prompts, offline recording with sync.

**Matching accuracy risk:** Early algorithms may not be accurate enough. Mitigation: Human review layer for MVP, continuous model improvement from user feedback, clear "this is early" messaging.

**Two-sided marketplace risk:** Need both seekers and employers to reach liquidity. Mitigation: Seed supply side (job seekers) first via waitlist, then targeted employer outreach with pre-qualified candidate promise.

## SaaS B2B Platform Requirements

### Project-Type Overview

Southbound is a two-sided B2B SaaS marketplace connecting job seekers with employers. Unlike single-tenant SaaS, this requires balancing the needs of two distinct user types while maintaining marketplace health and trust.

**Key SaaS characteristics:**
- Multi-tenant architecture (employers are tenants, job seekers are shared pool)
- Subscription-based revenue (employer-side monetisation)
- Marketplace dynamics (liquidity, matching, trust)
- Self-service onboarding for both sides

### Technical Architecture Considerations

**Multi-Tenancy Model**

| Tenant Type | Isolation Level | Data Scope |
|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| Employers | Logical (shared DB, tenant ID) | Own roles, culture profile, candidate interactions |
| Job Seekers | Shared pool | Own profile, applications, match history |
| Platform Admin | Global access | All data for moderation/support |

Employer data is isolated — they cannot see other employers' culture profiles or candidate pools. Job seekers exist in a shared marketplace visible to all employers they match with.

**Permission Model (RBAC)**

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| Job Seeker | Create/edit own profile, view matches, apply to roles, view culture insights |
| Employer Admin | Create/edit roles, view matched candidates, manage team members, view analytics |
| Employer Member | View candidates, schedule interviews (no billing/settings access) |
| Platform Admin | Moderate content, manage flags, view marketplace health |
| Support Agent | View profiles (read-only), respond to tickets, escalate issues |

### Subscription & Pricing Model

**Employer Tiers (B2B Revenue)**

| Tier | Price | Included | Target |
|------|-------|----------|--------|
| Starter | Free | 1 active role, basic matching | SMBs testing platform |
| Growth | R2,500/mo | 5 active roles, culture profile, candidate insights | Growing companies |
| Scale | R7,500/mo | Unlimited roles, priority matching, analytics dashboard | Mid-market |
| Enterprise | Custom | API access, ATS integration, dedicated support | Large employers |

**Job Seeker Model:** Free forever. Job seekers are the supply side — monetisation is employer-side only.

### Integration Requirements

**MVP Integrations:**
- Email (transactional notifications, match alerts)
- SMS (South African mobile-first users)
- Payment gateway (PayFast or similar for SA market)

**Growth Integrations:**
- ATS systems (BambooHR, Workday, Lever) — for enterprise employers
- Calendar (Google Calendar, Outlook) — interview scheduling
- LinkedIn (profile import, optional)
- WhatsApp Business API (high engagement in SA market)

### Compliance & Data Requirements

**POPIA Compliance (South African data protection):**
- Explicit consent for voice recording and profile creation
- Right to deletion (profile and all associated data)
- Data portability (export profile in standard format)
- Purpose limitation (data used only for matching)

**Employment Equity Act considerations:**
- No demographic data used in matching algorithm
- Transparent matching criteria (explainable, not black-box)
- Audit trail for compliance reporting

**Data Retention:**
- Active profiles: Indefinite while account active
- Inactive profiles: 24 months, then anonymised
- Voice recordings: Stored encrypted, deletable on request
- Match history: 36 months for analytics, then aggregated

### Implementation Considerations

**Mobile-First (African Market)**
- Progressive Web App for low-bandwidth resilience
- Offline-capable voice recording with background sync
- SMS fallback for critical notifications
- Data-light design (compressed audio, lazy loading)

**Scalability Path**
- Start with single-region (South Africa)
- Database sharding strategy for multi-country expansion
- CDN for voice file delivery across Africa
- Multi-currency support for pan-African expansion

## Project Scoping & Phased Development

### MVP Strategy & Philosophy

**MVP Approach:** Experience MVP
The core innovation of Southbound IS the experience — voice-first profiling that creates better matches. Without this experience working end-to-end, there's nothing to validate. The MVP must deliver the complete job seeker journey (profile → match → apply) and employer journey (post role → receive matches → review candidates).

**Resource Requirements:**
- Small team (3-5 people): 1 full-stack dev, 1 mobile/frontend, 1 ML/matching engineer, 1 designer, 1 founder/PM
- Timeline: 3-4 months to functional MVP
- Key hires: ML engineer critical for matching; can contract initially

### MVP Feature Set (Phase 1)

**Core User Journeys Supported:**
1. Thabo's journey (job seeker → voice profile → match → apply) ✅
2. Sipho's journey (employer → post role → receive matches → review) ✅
3. Basic admin moderation (flagging, review) ✅

**Must-Have Capabilities:**

| Feature | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| Voice capture (mobile web) | Core innovation — no voice, no product |
| Question flow (~8-10 min) | Captures enough signal for meaningful matching |
| Basic matching algorithm | Can be rule-based initially, ML later |
| Match display with explanations | Transparency is core differentiator |
| Job seeker dashboard | View matches, apply |
| Employer dashboard | Post roles, view matched candidates |
| Email/SMS notifications | Critical for engagement |
| Basic admin tools | Moderation, marketplace health |

**Explicitly NOT in MVP:**
- Interview recording / pre-post AI analysis
- Soft steering hints (growth feature)
- Organogram intelligence
- Multi-language support
- ATS integrations
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- WhatsApp integration

### Post-MVP Features

**Phase 2 (Growth) — Months 4-9:**
- Soft steering hints for transparent connections
- Employer analytics dashboard
- WhatsApp Business API integration
- Improved matching algorithm (ML-based)
- Candidate comparison tools
- Calendar integration for scheduling

**Phase 3 (Expansion) — Months 10-18:**
- Interview recording with AI analysis
- Organogram intelligence
- Multi-language support (Afrikaans, Zulu, Xhosa)
- ATS integrations (BambooHR, Workday)
- Nigeria/Kenya market expansion
- Enterprise tier features

**Phase 4 (Vision) — 18+ months:**
- Career coaching powered by profiling
- Internal mobility tools for enterprises
- Pan-African talent marketplace
- Industry-specific matching verticals

### Risk Mitigation Strategy

**Technical Risks:**

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Voice capture on poor networks | Progressive upload, offline recording, quality detection |
| Matching accuracy too low | Start with rule-based + human review, iterate with data |
| Audio processing costs | Compressed audio, tiered processing based on profile stage |

**Market Risks:**

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Job seekers don't complete profiles | Gamified progress, social proof, clear value messaging |
| Employers don't pay | Prove value with free tier, then upgrade path |
| Chicken-egg marketplace | Seed job seekers via waitlist, then approach employers with supply |

**Resource Risks:**

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Can't hire ML engineer | Contract initially, use rule-based matching for MVP |
| Team too small | Prioritise ruthlessly, manual processes where needed |
| Runway constraints | Launch lean MVP fast, validate before scaling team |

### Minimum Viable Team

| Role | Responsibility | MVP vs Growth |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| Founder/PM | Product, strategy, employer sales | MVP |
| Full-stack Dev | Core platform, backend | MVP |
| Mobile/Frontend Dev | Voice capture, PWA, dashboards | MVP |
| ML Engineer | Matching algorithm | Contract for MVP, hire for Growth |
| Designer | UX, brand, onboarding | Part-time for MVP |
